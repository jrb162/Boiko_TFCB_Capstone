# Boiko_TFCB_Capstone
This is a repository of files for the TFCB 2020 course capstone project, studying data on triple negative breast cancer imaging.

## Directory structure

- Analysis files folder (contains reports):
        - Tumor_markdown.rmd -- This contains research questions 1 and 2 with code, figures, and results/conclusions. It also contains my "About the Data" statement.
        - Tumor_ipython.ipynb -- This contains research question 3 with code, figure, and results/conclusions. It also contains my "reproducibility" statement.

- Primary data files folder:
        - tumor location raw data_final.xls -- This is the original, unaltered data file from https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.32765.
        - data_renamed.csv -- This is the version of the data that I cleaned up and worked with. I renamed the file to something shorter and a single word, I shortened/renamed some column headers to work more easily in RStudio and Python, and I removed missing data. I also saved the original Excel as a CSV file.
